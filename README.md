# BCL Package Manager (BPM)

*I* ***promise*** *that I won't make a bunch of heart puns*

This is the package manager for [BCL](github.com/spidertyler2005/BCL).

## Where is the package index hosted.

Currently we host it on a [github repo](https://github.com/spidertyler2005/BCL-package-repository.git) in a manner similar to winget.
Later, we will have an option for donations so we can use the money to get a *real* package index.

## Dependencies

- [BCL](github.com/spidertyler2005/BCL)
- Git
- Python (3.11 recommended)
- Internet (Duh)
